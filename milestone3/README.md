# **AI Text Intelligence Suite â€” Streamlit NLP Application**

**Overview**

The AI Text Intelligence Suite is an advanced NLP-powered Streamlit web application designed to analyze, summarize, and enhance written content using artificial intelligence.

This project integrates multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities such as readability analysis, summarization, and paraphrasing, all built within a secure user authentication system. It combines the practical utility of AI models with an interactive and educational interface â€” ideal for students, content creators, educators, and researchers who aim to understand or refine text quality.

      - Uses color-coded highlights and graphical charts to visually represent the ease or difficulty of text comprehension.

  -  **Purpose & Uses**
    - Helps writers, students, and educators assess how readable their text is.
    - Enables content creators to adapt tone and vocabulary for target audiences.
    - Serves as an educational tool to learn about linguistic complexity metrics.

- **ðŸ”¹ Module 2 â€” Advanced NLP (Summarization & Paraphrasing)**
  -  **Features Implemented:**
    - **Integration of Pretrained Transformer Models:**
      - Utilizes powerful Hugging Face models for text generation:
        - PegasusForConditionalGeneration
        - FLAN-T5
        - BART
    - **Adaptive Summarization Controls:**
      - Adds toggles for Short, Medium, and Long summaries depending on user preference.
    - **Evaluation Metrics (ROUGE):**
      - Implements ROUGE scoring to evaluate summary quality and accuracy.
    - **Sentence & Paragraph-Level Paraphrasing:**
      - Uses BART or T5 to rewrite text while maintaining context, allowing users to simplify or rephrase writing.
    - **Complexity Selector:**
      - Dropdown menu lets users choose paraphrase difficulty â€”
        - Simple (Easy-to-read)
        - Standard (Balanced)
        - Advanced (Rich vocabulary)
    - **Side-by-Side Comparison Interface:**
      - Displays original vs paraphrased content for visual clarity and learning impact.

  -  **Purpose & Uses**
    - Ideal for content rewriters, educators, and researchers to improve clarity and avoid redundancy.
    - Helps students simplify academic material or generate concise study notes.
    - Provides AI-assisted writing support, making it easier to summarize lengthy documents.
    - Encourages ethical and intelligent text reuse using NLP models instead of manual rewriting.
